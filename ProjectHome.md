After spending a day fighting with identity columns and the SQL Server 2005 Import/Export Wizard I learned about SqlBulkCopy from a post on David Hayden's blog and created this quick app to get around the problem.  It will copy data between identical tables and keep identity and null columns intact.  Used in conjunction with the generate script wizard you can make a complete database copy as long as you have sql access.
